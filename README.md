# Welcome
Hi! I'm Abbey, and I'm currently a 2nd-year IT student. I love to self-study during my free time, so I decided to document my devops journey so that I can look back at my notes and also learn how to document and share it with everybody through open source.

## What is DevOps Notes?

This will be a compilation and documentation of my notes while I'm learning different topics and technologies in DevOps. This is an on going notes so more phases will be added. I follow [WeMakeDevs's](https://github.com/WeMakeDevs/roadmaps/tree/main/DevOps) roadmap and [Saiyam Pathak's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l_n97Mt0ko) roadmap.

## Feedback? Corrections? Comments?

Feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/AbbeyIT/DevOps/issues)
